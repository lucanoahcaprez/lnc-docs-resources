This repository hosts supporting resources and assets for the documentation site  
👉 [docs.lucanoahcaprez.ch](https://docs.lucanoahcaprez.ch)

It serves as the central place for files, images, code snippets, and other reference
material that is linked throughout the documentation.

## 📂 Contents

- **Images** — diagrams, screenshots, and illustrations used in guides.  
- **Code samples** — example snippets and demo files referenced in tutorials.  
- **Static files** — additional resources linked directly from the docs.

from the main documentation site.
